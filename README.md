I was looking for such a tool and couldn't find one, so I decided to make one for myself. You're welcome to make any modifications to the code.
The python script allows you to extract and save tables from a pdf. The script uses python wrapper for tabula which requires java installed and the path set on your machine.

Usage:
Copy the py file to the location where your pdf files are, then run it on cmd with the pdf names on as a command line arguments.
For Ex: py Extract_tables_from_pdf.py bse.pdf tcs.pdf
You can provide any number of arguments here.
